        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>The Augarnath Temple in Meerut is devoted to Lord Shiva. The temple has historical importance as the first war of independence of India was also witnessed here. The actual date or year of the formation of the temple is not known but it is believed that the ‘shiva linga’ in the temple emerged on its own that is treated as a miracle of God and therefore attracts lots of devotees. In the past few years, several changes have been made in the temple. In 1968, a new temple was constructed and the old architecture was replaced. In 1987, a new hexagonal hall was also constructed there and in 2001, a ‘kalash’ (pitcher) made from 4.5 kg of gold was installed at the spire. </p>
