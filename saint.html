        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>Established in 1819 to cater to the needs of the nearby military garrison, this parish was founded under the guidance of Reverend Henry Fischer, a British Army chaplain and clergyman of the Church of England, stationed in Meerut, India. The parish's centerpiece, St. John the Baptist, stands as the oldest church structure in the northern region of India. Within its venerable walls, one can find a substantial yet non-operational pipe organ that relied on manual bellows for its air supply. The church's interior is adorned with wooden pews and kneelers, a brass eagle lectern, a marble baptistry, and stained-glass windows, all of which bear witness to nearly two centuries of history. It is the oldest church in Northern India and was built during the British colonial period. </p>
